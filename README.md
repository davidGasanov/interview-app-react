# Live coding assignment: Fetch and display product data

## Fetch data from https://dummyjson.com/products. 
The endpoint accepts a “search” parameter. 

## Response data type for products can be found in the “types” folder

## Display: title, category, price, availability and rating.

## Use any component you’d like with any styling. 
In this case, clarity is more important than visual aesthetics. (I recommend the table component).

## A loading indicator should be shown while data is being fetched.
